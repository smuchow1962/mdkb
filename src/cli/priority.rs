//! `mdkb dup --semantic` saturates every core for minutes and nothing is
//! waiting on it: it is a sweep someone asked for, not a query someone is
//! blocked on. Lowering this process changes no CPU-seconds — measured, the
//! pass costs what it costs — it changes who gets a core first when an editor,
//! a build and the audit all want one.
//!
//! Deliberately under `cli/`. The daemon serves MCP from a long-lived process
//! that answers interactive searches, so putting *it* in the background would
//! make every search pay for an audit nobody asked that process to run. The
//! only caller is the CLI's duplication entry point.

/// platform with no such class, and `false` if the kernel refused — neither is
/// something a caller should report, because an audit that ran at normal
/// priority is an audit that ran. That is why this returns a bool rather than a
/// `Result`: there is no failure here worth propagating, only a fact worth
/// asserting in a test.
///
/// macOS has a dedicated background *state* rather than a nice value, and it
/// throttles disk I/O along with CPU. For a sweep that reads the index once and
/// then spends minutes inside ONNX, that is the right trade. Elsewhere on unix
