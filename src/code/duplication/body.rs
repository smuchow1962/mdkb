//! A symbol's body text and the rename-invariant fingerprint of its shape.
//!
//! Nothing in the index holds a body — `code_symbols` stores a signature and a
//! range — so duplication re-derives it from the file plus the range, and
//! re-derives its AST from the parser the pipeline already built.
//!
//! The fingerprint hashes **node kinds only, never their text**. That is not an
//! optimisation: the embedding benchmark this feature is built on fails hardest
//! on exactly the case a reviewer cares about most — the same code with every
//! identifier renamed. Two bodies that differ only in names and literal values
//! walk the same kinds in the same order and land on the same simhash, which no
//! text-sensitive hash and no embedding can promise.
