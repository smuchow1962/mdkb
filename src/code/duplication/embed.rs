//! The semantic pass: a second model, run lazily, over what the structural

//! is one global instance shared by documents, memory and code search, and the
//! vectors it produced are on disk in `vectors.bin`, `vec_documents` and
//! `vec_memory`. Repointing it at a code model would invalidate all three and

//! *lower* than the adversarial pairs built to fool it (gap -0.0376): on this
//! task it is not weak, it is inverted. `JinaEmbeddingsV2BaseCode` truncated to
//! 256 dimensions scores +0.1503 — better than its own 768 dimensions, and a
//! third of the storage.
